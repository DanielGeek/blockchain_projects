# Web3 - Build a Smart Contract in Rust

In this project, I developed and deployed a smart contract using Rust, which keeps track of how many users have clicked a button on a web page. Below are the key aspects and technologies applied:

## Smart Contract Development:
Implemented a smart contract in Rust using wasm-pack to compile the Rust code to JavaScript for Node.js.
Defined and exported functions to initialize, set clicks, and get contract account data.

## Struct and Function Definitions:
Created structs Account and Context to store the contract's state.
Developed functions initialise, set_click, and get_contract_account to manage the contract's logic.

## Testing and Validation:
Wrote unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of the contract's functionality.
Utilized serde for serializing and deserializing the contract's data.

## Blockchain Interaction:
Integrated the smart contract with a web application to track user interactions.
Deployed the smart contract using Node.js and verified its performance with multiple users.

## Key Learnings:
- Gained in-depth knowledge of Rust and WebAssembly (Wasm) for smart contract development.
- Enhanced my skills in Rust, particularly in handling data serialization with serde and developing WebAssembly modules.
- Learned to implement, test, and deploy smart contracts in a structured and efficient manner.
- Acquired experience in creating secure and efficient blockchain-based applications.

This project showcases my ability to develop a comprehensive smart contract using Rust, including the implementation of essential features for decentralized applications.
