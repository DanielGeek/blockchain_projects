# A collection of example games

This is a collection of example games built on Solana. The games are built using the [Anchor](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/) framework. The games are meant to be used as a starting point for building your own games on Solana.

The easiest way to create a Solana game is to use the command: 

```bash
npx create-solana-game <name>
```

It will create you a preset anchor program with a js and a unity client.
