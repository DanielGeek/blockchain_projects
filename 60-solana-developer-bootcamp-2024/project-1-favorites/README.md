# Project 1: Favorites Application

This is a basic Anchor app using PDAs to store data for a user, and Anchor's account checks to ensure each user is only allowed to modify their own data.

It's used by the [https://github.com/solana-developers/professional-education](Solana Professional Education) course.

We recommend creating a separate github repository for each project and commiting your code as you follow along the video.

## Running This Project

We highly recommend [creating your own github repository](https://github.com/new) and building along with the video. This will help you learn the most and give you a reference to look back on later.

If you want to check the final result of the project, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```
npm i
anchor build
anchor test
```

You should see the tests pass once completed.
